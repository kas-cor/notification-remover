## Architecture Evolution

### Current: MVVM + Repository
```
View â†’ ViewModel â†’ Repository â†’ Database/Preferences
```

### Target: Clean Architecture + MVVM
```
UI â†’ Presentation â†’ Domain â†’ Data
```

### Future: Modular Architecture
```
:app
â”œâ”€â”€ :feature:settings
â”œâ”€â”€ :feature:notifications  
â”œâ”€â”€ :feature:statistics
â”œâ”€â”€ :core:database
â”œâ”€â”€ :core:network
â””â”€â”€ :core:common
```

## Performance Targets
