## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with these additions:

```kotlin
// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive names
private fun validateRemovalTime(minutes: Int): Boolean

// ‚ùå Bad: Abbreviated names  
private fun valTime(m: Int): Boolean

// ‚úÖ Good: Clear intent
val isNotificationAccessGranted = checkNotificationPermission()

// ‚ùå Bad: Unclear purpose
val flag = checkPerm()
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **MVVM Pattern**: Use ViewModel for business logic, View for UI
2. **Repository Pattern**: Single source of truth for data access
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single responsibility
4. **Dependency Injection**: Ready for Hilt implementation

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no feature changes)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(ui): add swipe-to-delete for app settings

fix(service): resolve memory leak in notification handler

docs(readme): update installation instructions

test(data): add unit tests for AppSettingEntity validation
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
./gradlew test

# Connected tests (requires device/emulator)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# All tests
./gradlew check
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests** for business logic and utilities
- **Integration tests** for database operations
- **UI tests** for critical user flows

```kotlin
// Example unit test
@Test
fun `validateRemovalTime returns false for negative values`() {
    val result = ValidationUtils.isValidRemovalTime(-1)
    assertFalse(result)
}

// Example UI test
@Test
fun testAddAppSettingFlow() {
    onView(withId(R.id.addAppSettingButton)).perform(click())
    onView(withText("WhatsApp")).perform(click())
    onView(withId(R.id.removalTimeInput)).perform(typeText("30"))
    onView(withText("Add")).perform(click())
    onView(withText("WhatsApp")).check(matches(isDisplayed()))
}
```
